#🏃 Ultra-Marathon Running EDA Project
##📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes ultra-marathon running data using the dataset "The Big Dataset of Ultra Marathon Running" from Kaggle.
It contains data from over two centuries of ultramarathon race results including performance, age, gender, and race details.

The main goal is to explore trends in athlete performance, with a focus on 50km and 50mi races held in the USA during 2020.

##⚙️ Tools & Libraries
-Python (Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy)
-Jupyter Notebook
-Matplotlib

##🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
-Filtered dataset for 50km and 50mi races in the USA (2020 only)
-Extracted athlete age from birth year
-Removed unnecessary columns and cleaned string formatting
-Converted data types to numeric where needed
-Created new columns for race season based on month

##📊 Exploratory Analysis & Insights
📌 Visuals and Findings:
-Race Distribution by Gender and Length
-Average Speed vs Age (50mi Races)
-Linear regression shows speed trends across ages
-Violin Plot of Speed by Gender and Distance
-Highlights distribution differences between male and female runners

##🔎 Questions Answered:
-Which age groups perform best in 50mi races?
-Is there a noticeable gender gap in average speed?
-Does season affect performance?

🧠 Key Insights
-The best age group for 50mi performance (20+ participant groups) had an average speed of 7.902252 mph.
-Summer races show a slight drop in average performance compared to winter, spring and fall.
